# EP

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is the repo of Armand González TFM project performed in an
internship at Sant Pau Hospital under the mentorship of PhD. Olivia
Belbin.

In here I will keep updating the R code in which I am working on and
keep track of the changes I’ve been making.

The goal of the EP package is to conduct epistatic analysis from a case
control dataset of SNP data.

An Rmarkdown report with its respective html explaning all the steps
performed for the analysis of the epistasis project package can be found
on the folder /analysis.
